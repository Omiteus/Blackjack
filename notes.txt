Ideas for improvement
1. Ask for player name and display that instead of "Player" string
2. Score keeping for wins and losses
3. Betting and virtual money
4. Achievements/statistics
    -win without hitting (x?)
    -win with 5 cards or more (x?)
    -win x amount of money in total
    -lose x amount of money in total
    -press hit button x times
    -bet x amount in one go
    -win x amount in one go
    -lose x amount in one go
    - achievement/statistics list/view
5. save player stats in file
6. load player stats from file
7. do above in some database format and not just .txt
